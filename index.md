# Hello
I am a data scientist with a passion for medical research to enhance the quality of healthcare with artificial intelligence. My area of expertise is deep learning, particularly in image processing, including image detection and segmentation, as well as data analytics. Currently, I'm interested in Vision Transformer (ViT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Continuously seeking to improve my knowledge, I constantly update the latest developments in the AI field.
